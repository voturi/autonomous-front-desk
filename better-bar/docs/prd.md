# PRD – Ultra-Modern SEO-First Website Platform  
**Product:** AI Receptionist for Tradies  
**Document Type:** Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**File:** prd.md  
**Owner:** Founder  
**Status:** Draft v1

## 1. Problem Statement

Most SaaS websites are:
- Template-driven
- Visually repetitive
- SEO-optimized but emotionally flat
- Marketing pages, not product experiences

For an AI-first startup, this creates a brand mismatch:
> The product feels intelligent and premium, but the website feels generic.

We need a website system that is:
- Ultra-modern in experience
- SEO-dominant in structure
- Product-like in interaction
- Founder-grade in growth performance

---

## 2. Product Vision

Create a **Product-as-Website Platform** that:
- Feels like an interactive AI interface
- Is technically flawless for SEO
- Converts buyer intent at high velocity
- Acts as a long-term distribution asset

This is not a landing page.  
This is the public interface of the company.
